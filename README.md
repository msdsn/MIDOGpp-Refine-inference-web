- Node.js 16+ for frontend development
- YOLO model file (`best.pt`) for mitotic figure detection

### Backend Installation

1. **Create virtual environment**:
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Ensure `best.pt` model file is in the project root directory
- This file contains the trained weights for mitotic figure detection

### AWS S3 Configuration (Recommended for Production)

For improved upload performance and scalability, configure AWS S3 for direct file uploads:

1. **Create AWS S3 Bucket**:
```bash
# Using AWS CLI
aws s3 mb s3://midog-inference-uploads --region us-east-1

# Enable CORS for web uploads
aws s3api put-bucket-cors --bucket midog-inference-uploads --cors-configuration file://cors.json
```

2. **Configure CORS policy** (`cors.json`):
```json
{
    "CORSRules": [
        {
            "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
            "AllowedMethods": ["PUT", "POST"],
            "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
            "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
        }
    ]
}
```

3. **Create IAM User and Policy**:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::midog-inference-uploads/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

4. **Set environment variables**:
```bash
# Copy example environment file
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env with your AWS credentials
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key_here
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET_NAME=midog-inference-uploads
```

**Benefits of S3 Integration**:
- ‚ö° **Faster uploads**: Direct S3 upload bypasses server bottlenecks
